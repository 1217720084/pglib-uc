# Power Grid Lib - Unit Commitment

This benchmark library is curated and maintained by the [IEEE PES Task Force on Benchmarks for Validation of Emerging Power System Algorithms](https://power-grid-lib.github.io/) and is designed to evaluate a well established version of the the Unit Commitment problem.  Specifically, these cases are designed for benchmarking algorithms that solve the following the Mixed-Integer Linear Program described in the formulation [PDF document](MODEL.pdf).

A detailed description of this mathematical model is available [here](tbd).  All of the cases files are curated in a json-based data format.  Open-source reference implementations are available in [TBD](.) and [TBD](.).

## Problem Overview

Discuss high level features / scope of the model (e.g. ramp rates, up time ect.).


## Case File Overview

A brief discussion of where the datasets come form.
